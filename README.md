It's a real time basketball shoot accuracy recorder that creates a 2D-heatmap for every player in your team. The recording is made through a 2D plot,
by left clicking to declare a succes and right to declare failure on the exact spot that the shot was made. The goal is to gather a database for each player,
including heatmaps and progress throughout the entire season
